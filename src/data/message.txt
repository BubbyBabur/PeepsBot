**Rules:**
Just don’t be stupid. Use common sense.
Academic dishonesty is cringe and any mention of content about checkpoints will be harshly censored and cracked down upon. Since the great Little has heard of the cheating methods, we are now required to follow Merchant policy. Cheating bad. If we hear that one of you cheated, you will be banned.
Spam goes in spam channels. Please. *trauma noises*
I’m not really sure how, but if you do somehow manage to ping everyone you will be oofed. Basically unnecessary pings are bad.
Everyone has emote perms! Communism for all! Unlike socialism, however, this is a privilege and not a right, so always make a poll or ask mods before removing emotes. Disobeying this rule will result in you not existing.
This is a police state and mods are allowed to enforce an absolutist regime on the proletariat. You stinky, we ban.
