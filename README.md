## PeepsBot

All the code for my PeepsBot Discord Bot. The code isn't really well organized, and I wish I had started with better inheritance and abstraction levels, but here I am. 

In short, PeepsBot takes in quotes from a Discord channel, and on a command, spews out a random one. It also stores all the quotes, and their corresponding weights, on a Google Spreadsheet.

It also keeps track of our Groovy history on this one Discord server, which was just for fun. This is also saved within a Google Spreadsheet.

The bot is usually hosted on Heroku, but I haven't taken the time to add more Dyno hours, so in the last few days of the month, the bot is hosted by my personal computer.

The bot is private, so ask Rog#7499 on Discord if you want the bot on your server.
